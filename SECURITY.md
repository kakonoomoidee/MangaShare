# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a security vulnerability in this project, we strongly encourage you to report it responsibly so that it can be fixed. Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been addressed.

### Steps to report a vulnerability:
  1. Email us at kakonoomoidee@gmail.com with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report."
  2. Provide a detailed description of the issue and any steps needed to reproduce it.
  3. If possible, include a proof of concept or any relevant logs or evidence that can help us understand the vulnerability.

We will review the report, acknowledge it, and work on a fix. We will notify you once the fix has been deployed and address the vulnerability in a public release note.

## Supported Versions
We will provide security updates and patches for the following versions:
  - v0.1.0-alpha (currently supported)

For older versions, we strongly recommend updating to the latest version to ensure you are protected with the latest security improvements.

## Security Best Practices

To help improve the security of the application, the following practices are encouraged:
  1. **Authentication:** Always use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) if available.
  2. **Input Validation:** Ensure that user inputs are sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection or XSS (cross-site scripting).
  3. **Encryption:** Use HTTPS for all communication to protect sensitive data in transit. Ensure passwords are securely hashed using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2).
  4. **Session Management:** Properly manage sessions to prevent session hijacking or fixation. Use secure cookies and set appropriate session timeouts.
  5. **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies and libraries up to date to minimize vulnerabilities due to outdated packages.
  6. **Access Control:** Apply the principle of least privilege and ensure that users only have access to data and functionality that they need.
